The attempt of this works is to incorporate modern signal processing and machine learning on one hand and new discoveries about human auditory cortex and neural coding on the other hand, in audio codec design.\\
A new parametrization of a typical audio codec is presented and a set of sub-optimal parameters is learned through neural networks. The error message is calculated based on human auditory model.
